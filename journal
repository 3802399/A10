Day 1 - May 3, 2023 (1 hr)

15 min - Selecting a project idea (weather app)

        A movie database project will:
          - utilize external files: save user locations and default location
          - utilize libraries: uses external libraries to get weather
          - utilize OOP: use classes to implement project

10 min - searched for and downloaded libraries
5 min - created API key for OpenWeatherMap and saved it to file
5 min - program code to load API key
25 min - program code to get weather data in class (OOP)

Day 2 - May 5, 2023 (1 hr)

5 min - write func to convert weather data to JSON to save locally if needed later on
20 min - create simple text-user-interface for weather app (there were a few bug)
10 min - create funcs to convert temps from and to kelvin, celsius, and fahrenheit (using @staticmethod)
25 min - create a class for settings that will be saved in file (such as favourite cities)

Day 3 - May 8, 2023 (1 hr)

40 min - rewrite settings class to be in one single settings file (as opposed to one file for favourite cities, and one for favourite temperature unit)
15 min - add a new settings python app/file to modify these settings
5 min - seperate weather functions into different files

Day 4 - May 9, 2023 (1 hr)

5 min - convert weather to users favorite temperature unit
35 min - overall improvements everywhere
10 min - clean up code to make room for a GUI (make it easier to install)
10 min - begin a GUI and set up a Treeview in Tkinter

Day 5 - May 10, 2023 (1 hr)

5 min - design full GUI layout
5 min - begin implementation
10 in - look for unicode symbols to represent "search" and "favourite" (turns out they're harder to find than I thought)
30 min - create search and favourite buttons and implement text box to display weather information in
10 min - begin implementation of a favourite button (partially done)

Day 6 - May 11, 2023 (1/2 hr)

15 min - finish basic GUI (not fully featured but runs)
5 min - make the settings app change between CLI and GUI

Day 7 - May 12, 2023 (1/2 hr)

10 min - try to look for units for wind speed so I can add wind speed. going terribly
10 min - gave up and instead increased font size and bolded main temperature in GUI and fixed fonts
10 min - found out how to get wind data and conversion units

Day 8 - May 15, 2023 (1 hr)

15 min - try to find way to edit heart pictures (symbols won't work) to reasonable size - gave up
15 min - implemented wind data and conversion units
10 min - make UI somewhat more aesthetically pleasing
15 min - make Treeview work again
5 min - remove text validation from entrybox of city, so that we can remove all characters from it when search happens

Day 9 - May 16, 2023 (1 hr)

5 min - fix bug where GUI does not show proper favourite/unfavourite on unfavourited cities
10 min - fix bug where only first word of a city name was being displayed (took a few Internet searches)
5 min - fix bug where clicking on empty portion of treeview would result in error
15 min - added a scrollbar to favourite cities treeview (looks better)
20 min - get local time of city
5 min - show local time of last update in GUI and CLI

Day 10 - May 17, 2023 (1 hr)

25 min - get sunrise/sunset and display it (actually quite hard)
5 min - bind enter/return key to city search box
10 min - round approximate sunrise/sunset time one minute up if the second variable is 30 or bigger
20 min - try to add image to a text box (apparently is IS possible) but fail so far

Day 11 - May 18, 2023 (1 hr)

5 min - fix city name favourite/unfavourite issue - ex, chicago is unfavourited but Chicago is favourited (fixed)
55 min - finally succeed in making images appear (turns out the tk.PhotoImage I was using needed to be global in the class, not local in a function, which would delete the image
          the instant the function was over)

Day 12 - May 19, 2023 (1 hr)

30 min - add ttk themes
20 min - kahoot quiz (I won by a large margin, so that was awesome)
5 min - add weather icon to text widget instead of own label
5 min - configure ttk themes to make it look better

Day 13 - May 23, 2023 (1 hr)

10 min - add a tkinter Frame around the weather box to show a border (otherwise it looks terrible)
50 min - work on adding a Settings application as a GUI
          - added radiobuttons, but functionality isn't done yet

Day 14 - May 24, 2023 (1 hr)

40 min - rearrange code and split GUI code into several parts - two Frames (the main weather window, the settings frame) and the main window itself that will manage
          the frames (previously, it was no frames and two windows - main weather and settings)
10 min - finish settings
10 min - fix a few bugs of settings

Day 15 - May 25, 2023 (1/2 hr)

Day 16 - May 26, 2023 (1/2 hr)

20 min - get code reviewed by neighbour (determined by seating) and get no improvement ideas
40 min - review code of partner and help them out

Day 18 - May 29, 2023 (1 hr - continuation)

30 min - change/add/delete code to make adding different data to GUI weather display easier
10 min - rewrite code that gets wind direction to make it more modular and easier to understand
5 min - fix bug that raises an error if the favourite temp unit is Kelvin (there is a variable that is loaded inside an if-statement with the conditions
          being that the favourite temp unit is C or F, but that variable is used later outside of that if-statement without being initialized if the favourite
          temp unit is K)
15 min - look for module to open a map in a web browser to show location of city - so far no success
